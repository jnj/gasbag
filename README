Gasbag is a scrobbling library for JVM languages. It is written in Scala.
Before using, configure by editing lastfm.properties.

Note:

Handshake and Now Playing are working in this library, but it is still
experimental. It is currently using the test-only client ID of "tst",
so do not use for production work as is.
